### My first repository in Github for Modern Software Development Course ###

Hi, I'm Ehsan Mohajer and here it's my first GitHub repository. I am student of 
"Full Stack System Development" at "Jamk: University of Applied Science" in Jyväskylä/Finland.
If you see this file on my project, it's because I'm learning Git.

My mood:

> Just Learning nodes

My favorite color:

Thank you so much for reading! ☺
